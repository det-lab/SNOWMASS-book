Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequodâ€™s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.

It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

``No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,'' says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820~\cite{T7-Scoresby}.

``It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. $\cdots$ Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal'' (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839~\cite{T7-Beale}.

``Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.'' ``Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.''  ``A field strewn with thorns.'' ``All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.''

Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.

Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book is but a draught---nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!
